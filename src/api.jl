# @brief Enqueue an FFT transform operation, and return immediately (non-blocking)
# @details This transform API is the function that actually computes the FFT transfrom. It is non-blocking as it
#          only enqueues the OpenCL kernels for execution. The synchronization step has to be managed by the user.
# @param[in]  plHandle Handle to a plan previously created
# @param[in]  dir Forwards or backwards transform
# @param[in]  numQueuesAndEvents Number of command queues in commQueues; number of expected events to be returned in outEvents
# @param[in]  commQueues An array of cl_command_queues created by the client; the command queues must be a proper subset of
#             the devices included in the plan context
# @param[in]  numWaitEvents Specify the number of elements in the eventWaitList array
# @param[in]  waitEvents Events that this transform should wait to complete before executing on the device
# @param[out] outEvents The runtime fills this array with events corresponding 1 to 1 with the input command queues passed
#             in commQueues.  This parameter can be NULL or nullptr, in which case client is not interested in receiving notifications
#             when transforms are finished, otherwise if not NULL the client is responsible for allocating this array, with at least
#             as many elements as specified in numQueuesAndEvents.
# @param[in]  inputBuffers An array of cl_mem objects that contain data for processing by the FFT runtime.  If the transform
#             is in place, the FFT results will overwrite the input buffers
# @param[out] outputBuffers An array of cl_mem objects that will store the results of out of place transforms.  If the transform
#             is in place, this parameter may be NULL or nullptr.  It is completely ignored
# @param[in]  tmpBuffer A cl_mem object that is reserved as a temporary buffer for FFT processing. If clTmpBuffers is NULL or nullptr,
#             and the runtime needs temporary storage, an internal temporary buffer will be created on the fly managed by the runtime.
# @return Enum describing error condition; superset of OpenCL error codes
